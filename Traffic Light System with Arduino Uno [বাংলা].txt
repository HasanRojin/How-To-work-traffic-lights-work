  Description:

Welcome to Barcode! In this tutorial, we'll show you how to create a traffic light system using an Arduino Uno, a Red LED, a Yellow LED, and a Green LED. ðŸš¦ðŸ”§

 Components Needed:
- Arduino Uno
- 1 Red LED
- 1 Yellow LED
- 1 Green LED
- 3 Resistors (220Î©)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)

 Wiring Diagram:
1. Red LED:
   - Connect the positive leg (longer leg) of the Red LED to digital pin 5 on the Arduino through a 220Î© resistor.
   - Connect the negative leg (shorter leg) of the Red LED to the GND pin on the Arduino.

2. Yellow LED:
   - Connect the positive leg of the Yellow LED to digital pin 6 on the Arduino through a 220Î© resistor.
   - Connect the negative leg of the Yellow LED to the GND pin on the Arduino.

3. Green LED:
   - Connect the positive leg of the Green LED to digital pin 7 on the Arduino through a 220Î© resistor.
   - Connect the negative leg of the Green LED to the GND pin on the Arduino.
